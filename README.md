## What is PCGEx + ZoneGraph?

This is a **companion plugin for [PCGEx](https://github.com/Nebukam/PCGExtendedToolkit)** that bridges PCGEx cluster data with Epic's [ZoneGraph plugin](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/learning/tutorials/qz6r/unreal-engine-zonegraph-quick-start-guide), converting cluster topology into ZoneGraph data for AI navigation.

### Experimental Status

Both this plugin and Epic's ZoneGraph plugin are **experimental**. Epic warns that "ZoneGraph will have API breaking changes as its development progresses." If something breaks, [open an issue](https://github.com/Nebukam/PCGExElementsZoneGraph/issues) and I'll look into it.
